 ## Introduction 
Working parents, especially a mother always finds it difficult to join back her work because they do not have much resources to send their young ones to a good day care.Picking an option from so many options available online and in person is always a big task.Especially for kids with special needs or who need extra attention, finalizing a good day care is of utmost importance.We’ve tried to address these problems by creating an app that allows a user to select a city where they reside/ or are planning to go and know about the 10 best and affordable day cares in their location.The user will be presented with the complete detail about a particular day care which will include its address, contacts and weblink to name a few.Not only this, but if the user wants to ask any question, in general, about a specific topic or wants to give in more information, they can go to our reviews section and share their information with others. 
## Design Process
   * Built a full stack app using the MVC paradigm, created our  server-side API, added user authentication, and connected the app to a database and deployed the app on a web  server.
   * Built on the agile development methodologies that we have  used throughout this course.
   * Instead of using the  HTML for the front end, used handlebars for displaying the front end version of the app.
   * All of this information is stored directly in our website for easy access.
   * We used a framework that was both easy-to use, but also responsive and optimize for the user’s experience.
   * We used Heroku web server to host our app and added a third party JAWS DB in order to display the seeded contents from the database.
